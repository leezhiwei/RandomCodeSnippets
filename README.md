These pieces are code are just random code that I written out of fun when learning a new language
## Languages that are included in this list. (will update as I learn more)
1. Python (most proficient)
2. C (still learning getting hang of it.)
3. C++ (still don't know how is it better?)
4. C# (In the process of learning from school.)
5. T-SQL/MySQL (I know some may say its not a programming language but might as well include it here.)
6. Java (Not started, but learn after C# next semester.)
7. Rust (More languages)


## Background
Well, I want to keep learning more. Therefore challenging myself to learn more and more languages. Posting my code here for fun. 

## If anyone wants to use these code, read here.
If someone wants to use the code snippets, feel free. If you want you can credit me, or not. I don't mind.
