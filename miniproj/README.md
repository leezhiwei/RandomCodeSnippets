# Mini-Projects folder
Hello and welcome to the mini-proj folder, where small inventions of mine exists
I currently have 2 projects present, G-Drive uploader and compileandrun
1. G-Drive uploader is cause I challenged myself, to code for my dad, he needed to upload a zip file to google drive, feel free to change the code and use it.
2. Compileandrun is cause I want to see which programming languages go faster. So far I think cpp is fastest lol. cpp go brr.
