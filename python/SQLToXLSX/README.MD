Basically we use this ERP software called Exact Globe, I need to get the Description from the Item Code, thus I figured its easier through MSSQL and PyODBC, with permission from my boss, I dug into the database and found a table called dbo.Items and used a select statement recursively to get the Description. BTW the server IP and Database name is not the same.
