# Week 5
This is a weird week, this week is WhiteSpace week, which in each semester, we get to study from home. As per tradition I made a programming paper close to what we got. It is quite a bit harder than expected. I also threw in a curve ball and replaced a CSV (Comma seperated value) into a DSV (Dot seperated value). The DSV file is generated by [this python script](/python/fakerdsv.py).
